🩺 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images using CNN

This project focuses on automatic detection of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model analyzes X-ray scans and classifies them into Normal or Pneumonia categories.

The system was trained and evaluated on balanced chest X-ray datasets, and additional experiments were conducted to analyze model generalization across different age groups (Pediatric vs Adult).

📌 Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. Manual analysis of chest X-rays by radiologists can be time-consuming and subjective.

This project proposes a deep learning based automated system that:

Detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images

Uses a custom CNN architecture

Evaluates model performance using ROC-AUC

Studies cross-domain generalization between pediatric and adult datasets

Provides explainability using Grad-CAM / Grad-CAM++
